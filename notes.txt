props is sthe only param. you can destructure them by adding curly braces

can't use key as a prop
the key goes on the component, not on the html element (i.e. div) in the component

From adding the semantic-ui Dropdown into the Expence component. Whether it was in the div or out.
Event if it was the only thing in the Expence component
chunk-ZKMK3N6I.js?v=7dd40ce1:519 Warning: findDOMNode is deprecated in StrictMode. findDOMNode was passed an instance of RefFindNode2 which is inside StrictMode. Instead, add a ref directly to the element you want to reference. Learn more about using refs safely here: https://reactjs.org/link/strict-mode-find-node
but removing all my code and just putting in the example code for Dropdown still has that error
